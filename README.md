## What Is A Cryptex?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptex  
A cryptex is a form of locked box in the shape of a cylinder.  
The lock is similar to a bicyle combination lock, with the discs encircling the body, and the secret compartment stored within the shaft.  
Cryptexes were popularized by Dan Brown in his novel The DaVinci Code.
